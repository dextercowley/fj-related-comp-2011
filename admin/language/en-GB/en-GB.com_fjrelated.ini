FJRC1="Welcome to the FJ Related Articles component. This component allows you to create list and blog menu items based on the keywords in the metadata of the articles. These menu items (also called layouts) are similar to the standard Joomla! Category List and Category Blog menu items. However, instead of selecting articles to show based on Category, articles are selected based on the keywords you enter when you write an article. The next section describes how to use this component. More documentation is available at the" 
FJRC10="Run the menu item from the Joomla! front end. Articles with matching keywords will show automatically in the layout."
FJRC11="This example illustrates how you might use this component. Say you have a site with articles about animals. Animals are classified based on different attributes, such as whether they are typically pets, farm animals, or zoo animals; whether they are mammals, reptiles, or birds; their size, such as large, medium, or small; and whether or not they are dangerous."
FJRC12="Say that you want to create a blog page that shows articles for all animals that are large and dangerous. Here is what you would do. "
FJRC13="Create an article with the keywords 'Large, Dangerous'. If you like, you could put text in this article to display in the heading of the layout."
FJRC14="In the site, add the keyword 'Large' to all of the articles about large animals and 'Dangerous' to all articles about dangerous animals."
FJRC15="Create a Related Article List or Blog menu item using the article created in (1) above as the Intro Article. Select the option to match only articles that match 'All' keywords. Select the other desired parameters for how the layout will show and how articles will be selected."
FJRC16="That's it! Your layout will include all of the articles that contain the keywords large and dangerous animals. Note that you can change this example to include large or dangerous animals simply by changing the 'Match Any or All Keywords' parameter from 'All' to 'Any'."
FJRC17="Articles by Author Example"
FJRC18="You can create a blog or list layout to show all articles by an author (or author alias) just by creating a selected article with no keywords. Then set 'Match on Author' or 'Match on Author Alias' parameter to 'Yes'. This will give you all of the articles by this author (or author alias)." 
FJRC19="Selected Article Layout"
FJRC2="project wiki page"
FJRC20="Say you want to create a layout with a manually selected list of articles. This is very easy to do."
FJRC21="Decide on an unused keyword (for example, 'Assortment 1'). Add this keyword to the articles you wish to include in the list."
FJRC22="Create an article with this keyword to use as the Intro Article for the layout."
FJRC23="Create the list or blog layout using this Intro Article. Chose the other desired options."
FJRC24="With this method, you can have as many list or blog layouts of selected articles as you like, just by using a different keyword for each layout."
FJRC3="To use this component, just follow these simple steps."
FJRC4="Create an article to be the 'Intro' article for the menu item. Normally, this article will have one or more keywords entered in its metadata. These keywords will be used to select the articles to show in the layout."
FJRC5="Create the desired menu item. Navigate to the Menu Item Manager and click on the New button. Under FJ Related, there will be two new Menu Items. Select either the Related Articles Blog Layout or Related Articles List Layout. Here you have the same options to control the layout that you have for the standard Category List and Category Blog layouts. You can also fine-tune the way articles are selected." 
FJRC6="You can include articles that match <i>any</i> of the keywords in the Intro Article or you can include only those articles that include <i>all</i> of the keywords of the Intro Article."
FJRC7="You can include articles that match the Intro Article's author or author alias." 
FJRC8="You can limit articles by section or category."
FJRC9="If needed, enter or edit the keywords for the articles you wish to display."
